# Dockerized PHPUnit for WordPress

Run your WordPress unit tests with PHPUnit in a Docker container. Keep your
code and testing database isolated.

This container is designed for orchestration with Docker Compose. For an example
of how to do this, visit my [Docker Compose WordPress development][development]
repo.
